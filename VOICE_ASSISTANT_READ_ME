# VoiceBuddy — Python Voice Assistant

A simple, beginner-friendly Python voice assistant that listens to voice commands and performs everyday tasks — telling the time, searching the web, doing calculations, opening apps, and more. Built during a Python programming internship at Oasis Infobyte to explore speech recognition, text-to-speech, and basic automation.

## Key Features
- Listens to voice commands via your microphone
- Responds with natural-sounding speech
- Wake words supported (e.g., “Hello” or “Hey Buddy”)
- Tells current time and date
- Performs web searches and opens web pages
- Executes basic spoken calculations
- Tells random jokes
- Opens system calculator (where applicable)
- Echoes/repeats user phrases
- Microphone calibration for better handling of background noise
- Graceful shutdown on voice command

---

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- SpeechRecognition — speech-to-text
- pyttsx3 — text-to-speech
- webbrowser — open URLs and search results
- pyperclip (optional) — clipboard handling

---

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+ installed
- A working microphone and audio drivers
- (Optional) A virtual environment for isolating dependencies

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/SAIKIRANBIRADAR/OASIS_INFOBYTE.git

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3. Install required Python packages:
   pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyperclip

4. Ensure your system's microphone is accessible and configured.

## Running the Assistant
- Run the main script (replace with actual filename if different):
  python voice_assistant.py

- The assistant will greet you and listen for the wake word. Speak clearly and allow a short pause after commands.

---

## Example Voice Commands
- "Hello" / "Hey Buddy" — wake and start interaction  
- "What time is it?" — current time  
- "What's the date today?" — current date  
- "Search for Python tutorials" — opens browser search results  
- "Calculate five plus seven" — basic arithmetic  
- "Tell me a joke" — hears a joke response  
- "Open calculator" — opens system calculator (if supported)  
- "Repeat after me: <phrase>" — assistant repeats the phrase  
- "Goodbye" / "Shut down" — exit the assistant politely

---

## Tips & Troubleshooting
- If the assistant struggles to hear you:
  - Run microphone calibration (if available)
  - Move closer to the mic and reduce background noise
  - Check system microphone permissions
- For noisy environments, increase the recognizer’s energy threshold or use calibration routines.
- If web searches or opening apps fail, verify default applications and network connectivity.
